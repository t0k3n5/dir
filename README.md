# [!]: This is an edited version of the PDF file- it's easier to understand on there, so I suggest you read that!

<h1>README</h1>
<br>
(Slight) Terms of agreement
<hr>
By using this open-source file you agree to:
Use the file ‘dir’ only for directional uses and not any other forms of folder-usage. For
example:
<br>
-	Tracking of any kind
<br>
-	Watching something on the PC (Clicks, Websites visited)
<br>
-	Installing items
<br>
-	Uninstalling items
<br>
-	Ads
<br>
-	Paid access
<br>
Unless this is tutorial or learning based activity (teaching yourself or others on how to do it manually using this folder)

However, if this is not any of those you may do anything else. Here are some examples of allowed and not allowed activities.

- Tracking the number of clicks:	No
- Listing suggested videos based on recent activity:	No (Because this is tracking activity)
- Creating a random password:	Yes

As you can tell, most of these were not allowed due to tracking activity, only one was allowed because it did not disobey any of these rules. Although these rules are incredibly tight and strict, this is for protection and so if you do ever use this file for illegal-based activity (against the rules, not actually illegal) and publish it, we should have full right to take this down, due to forking we should be able to get this file or audit logs if deleted.

You may now continue with using the folder now you have read this.
